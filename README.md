A simple script to launch blockify with spotify and automatically minimize without any fuzz
 
## Requirments
- [blockify](https://github.com/serialoverflow/blockify)

Manjaro 20 with the default installation of spotify from AUR and blockify

## Usage
`git clone [repo name here]`

This is my first bash script made for personal use, apologies for the messy code
